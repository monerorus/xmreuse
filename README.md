# `xmreuse`

A toolkit to assist with the reuse of rings across Cryptonote blockchain forks

## What's in this toolkit?

This toolkit currently only includes a Node.js tool (`npm` package `xmreuse`) in the `/nodejs` folder, this will be translated over to Python and PHP in time.

## Getting started
### Node.js

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sneurlax/xmreuse
cd xmreuse
npm install
node daemon.js --verbose
```
